# Phoenix Portal - PREVIEW

### What is Phoenix?

Phoenix is the new open finance protocol currently live on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Wanchain. It is a hub for connecting different decentralized ledgers to each other and users, and also for connecting with traditional finance applications. The first iteration of Phoenix will be a marketplace for hybrid decentralized/traditional financial products.

Phoenix is pioneering a cross-chain DeFi protocol for writing options exposure for multiple assets from within collateral pools. This groundbreaking Multi-Asset Single Pool (MASP) methodology for decentralized peer-to-pool options platforms enables anyone anywhere to leverage or hedge their positions in a variety of cryptoassets. Currently live on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Wanchain, Phoenix intends to bring its blockchain-agnostic Phoenix Protocol for Options (PPO) to other chains.

The next product under development is the decentralized leveraged token protocol, to be launched on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Wanchain in Q2 2021.
