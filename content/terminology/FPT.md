FPT means the FinNexus Pool Token, as the shares in the FPO v1.0 liquidity pools.

FPO v1.0 is a decentralized options protocol with a peer-to-pool model. The liquidity pool is created when individual liquidity providers contribute liquidity by locking their crypto assets in the pool. The liquidity provider receives a pool token, as FPT, which represents their share of ownership in the pool. 

It works similar as the Uniswap LP token or Balancer LP token (BPT), but in the options collateral/liquidity pool.

Options exposure sold to options buyers will earn options premiums. These premiums will automatically accrue in the MASP liquidity pool and, as premiums compound over time, there should be an increased value reflected in the FPT tokens. Remember that these FPT tokens represent are pro-rata share in the liquidity pool. Returns of pool participants are easily measured by the pool share net value.

Currently, FPTs in the USDC pool on Ethereum, in the FNX pool on Ethereum, and  in the FNX/WAN pool on Wanchain, are named as FPT-A, FPT-B and FPT-C respectively.
