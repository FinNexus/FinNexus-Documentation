MASP stands for Multi-Asset-Single-Pool. It is the core mechanism applied in FPO v1.0.

FPO v1.0 is a decentralized peer-to-pool options protocol, with liquidity pools as the counterparty for writing and settling option contracts.

'Multi-Asset' features in the liquidity pools enables the creation and trading of options from any type of underlying asset, including crpyto assets, commodities, fiats, stocks, indexes, etc. The potential for the underliers can be unlimited.

Also, 'Multi-Asset' means that there can be multiple types of crypto assets in the liquidity pool. For example, FPO v1.0 now has a USDC pool on Ethereum. It may include any stable coins like USDT, DAI, etc.,on Ethereum in later updates.

'Single-Pool' does not mean that there is only one pool in FPO v1.0. This mechanism means that one liquidity pool may power many different option contracts all together. Liquidity can be shared automatically, different from the traditional order books. There are currently two pools (USDC and FNX) live on Ethereum and one hybrid pool (FNX/WAN) live on Wanchain.

The MASP (Multi-Asset Single Pool) Liquidity Pool in the FPO is much different than liquidity pool concepts found on other DeFi platforms like Uniswap or Balancer. These two, in particular, behave as automated market makers for cryptocurrency swaps. MASP Liquidity powered by the collateral token (in USDC, FNX on Ethereum and WAN, FNX on Wanchain, and more could be added) is the liquidity solution for both the creation and settlement of options contracts, as well as the transaction between those options.

The unique MASP system — Multi-Asset Single-Pool — allows the users to gain exposure to a variety of bespoke cash-settled options positions on a variety of underlying assets, initially BTC and ETH. On 4th Nov 2020, we included $MKR, $LINK and $SNX as the additional underlying assets for FPO options.
