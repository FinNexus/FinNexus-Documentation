## Liquidity Pools (LP) 

DeFi is changing how finance is working in many ways. One of the most interesting ways is the ability to power the financial market with liquidity pools. 

Collective liquidity or monetary pools are not DeFiâ€™s creation, but in traditional finance, pools like these often mean under-the-table operations and non-transparency. However, with blockchain technology, everything is coded in smart contracts and open to the public. Pools can be as transparent as they need to be, and it is a cost-efficient and effective way to boost liquidity.

There are different kinds of pools elaborately programmed for liquidity in DeFi in various scenarios, and the application is ever-growing. Lending pools, market-making pools and options collateral pools are among the best known.
