## IV

IV stands for Implied Volatility.

It is a metric that captures the market's view of the likelihood of changes in a given asset's price. 

Implied volatility is often used to price options contracts: High implied volatility results in options with higher premiums and vice versa.

Implied volatility does not predict the direction in which the price change will proceed. Low volatility means that the price likely won't make broad, unpredictable changes.

Implied volatility can be determined by using an option pricing model. It is the only factor in the model that isn't directly observable in the market. Instead, the mathematical option pricing model uses other factors to determine implied volatility and the option's premium.
