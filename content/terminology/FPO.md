FPO stands for The FinNexus Protocol for Options. It is a cross-chain, permissionless protocol for options built by FinNexus.

It had two versions before as v0.1 and v1.0.

The first experimental version of FPO v0.1 went live mid-year 2020 on Wanchain and was currently terminated for future upgrades.
The official release of FPO v1.0 went live in Nov 2020 on both Ethereum and Wanchain.

For details of FPO v1.0, please go to [this page](https://www.docs.finnexus.io/options/v1.0/) for more information.
