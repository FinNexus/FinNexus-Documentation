## Overview

FinNexus is aimed to be live with fully decentralized governance by its community. This will give control of the protocol to FNX tokenholders, meaning that updates to the protocol and management of the treasury can only be performed with approval from FNX holders.

## Process

Decentralized governance is done, via forum discussions and, voting on proposals held on the FinNexus Snapshot on [Ethereum](https://snapshot.page/#/finnexus) and [Wanchain](https://vote.wandevs.org/#/).

The governance process begins on the [FinNexus Governance Forum](https://forum.finnexus.io/) where proposals are first submitted for discussion. If the community signals its interest and any necessary modifications to the proposal are made, the proposal is submitted to Snapshot off-chain community governance, where tokenholders can vote with their token balances.

Only proposals posted to the Snapshot voting system by CORE can be considered binding if passed with a quorum. The Core proposals are decided by the FinNexus team.

If a Snapshot proposal is passed and no code is required to be implemented, the approved action can be taken. If code deployment is required, the code will go to audit if necessary, and then be proposed via on-chain governance at which point tokenholders will vote once more to deploy if the audit suggests big changes.

1. Proposals will only be considered valid if at least 5% of circulating FNX participates in the vote.
2. Votes will be scored as 1 FNX = 1 VOTE. 
3. Votes on Ethereum and Wanchain snapshot will be counted and added together.
4. After meeting conditions of rule 1, a simple majority is required for a winning vote.

## LP Governance Participation

FNX token holders and LPs that are staked in the FPO or other LP contracts can participate in governance. Initially, FNX Votes in all these addresses will be regarded the same and scored as 1 FNX = 1 VOTE. In later stages, different voting power may be granted.
