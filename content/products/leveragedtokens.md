# What is the FinNexus Protocol for Leveraged Tokens (FPLT)?

FPLT stands for FinNexus Protocol for Leveraged Tokens. It is one of the main products of FinNexus.

FPLT provides a decentralized way for creating and trading decentralized leveraged tokens on cryptoassets, like BTC, ETH, etc., on different chains. These leveraged tokens are powered by no-loss lending pools, where participants can earn interest. All the core functions of token minting, redeeming, taking leverages, borrowing and lending occur on-chain and are managed by smart contracts. It is a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and non-custodial protocol.

FPLT’s goal is to make it simple to trade leveraged tokens in an easy, secure, transparent and decentralized way. It also provides a friendly venue for lenders to earn interest for powering the leveraged positions for the leveraged tokens.

# FPLT v1.0
## Introduction

The FinNexus Protocol for Leveraged Tokens (FPLT) v1.0 is a decentralized and non-custodial protocol for creating and trading decentralized leveraged tokens, which are powered by lending pools. The protocol is accessible through a joint interface that supports multiple blockchains. 
FinNexus Leveraged Tokens give holders leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without having to worry about actively managing a leveraged position. The rebalancing mechanism will make the holders’ leverage exposure within a fixed level, no matter how the underlier’s price moves. Therefore, token holders will never get liquidated, unlike the cases when taking part in margin trading or perpetuals.

FinNexus leveraged tokens are asset-backed tokens, NOT synthetic assets and created with 100% collateralization, in collaboration with other decentralized exchanges. Real cryptoasset borrowing and transactions are done through smart contracts to back the value of the leveraged tokens. With the help of the rebalancing mechanism on-chain, a fixed leverage or range of leverage is maintained for the holders, and anyone can monitor and verify the real time collaterals and leverage positions embedded in the tokens anytime in a transparent way.

To power the leveraged exposures, lending pools are created. When leveraged tokens are created, it will automatically borrow the equivalent amount of cryptoassets from the pools, to take leveraged positions, and the pool participants will earn passive interest returns.
