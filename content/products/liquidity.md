# Liquidity Mining

The [FinNexus Options Liquidity Mining DApp](https://liquidity.finnexus.io/) rewards participants with extra FNX for providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16)

## About FNX Liquidity Mining

A healthy FNX ecosystem requires deep liquidity pools so that community members may enter larger FNX positions with as small a price slippage as possible. Though FNX is also listed on a variety of centralized exchanges, Uniswap will remain a major gateway into the FNX ecosystem on Ethereum. 

FNX ERC20 tokens will be distributed as rewards to liquidity providers to the [FNX/ETH pool on Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16). 

As the team indicated [here](https://medium.com/finnexus/finnexus-will-use-business-development-innovative-monetary-policy-to-bootstrap-network-effects-e6b772a515cf) and [here](https://medium.com/finnexus/capturing-value-with-the-fnx-token-2747711c44f) in previous discussions about bootstrapping network effects to ensure FNX token value capture, the token bucket in our whitepaper and [tokenomics](https://medium.com/finnexus/fnx-tokenomics-update-382dcbc5d1b9) reserved for Community Rewards Fund (Mining Incentives) will be used for liquidity incentives. This category of tokens is intended to be distributed to active and engaged FinNexus ecosystem participants. We store these FNX tokens at [this Wanchain address](https://www.wanscan.org/address/0xd5b5965754102660d9ccE5Bc57A7Dc2a87e359d9) and will be bridged on Ethereum with the mining campaign.


The [FinNexus](https://twitter.com/fin_nexus) team hopes to institute more rewards for liquidity provision across other Uniswap pairs and perhaps even other protocols such as [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/) and [Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/). We are particularly keen to test our thesis that such a reward program leads to deeper liquidity pools as well as the durability and persistence of that depth.

We plan to have a series of liquidity mining activities, 
We are excited to continue supporting Uniswap while increasing the depth of our [FNX/ETH pool on Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16).

## Step by Step Guide

To stake and begin earning FNX liquidity mining rewards:

1. You must first provide liquidity to the [FNX/ETH pool on Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16). You will need to deposit an equal *value *(not the equal amount) of FNX ERC20 tokens and ETH coins into the pool.

1. After successfully contributing your crypto (you will need to approve FNX and/or ETH to interact with the Uniswap smart contract first), liquidity providers will receive UNI-V2 pool tokens. These UNI-V2 tokens represent your share of the FNX/ETH liquidity pool. You can track the size of the pool and your share of it [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16#balances). The share of liquidity provided by FinNexus Foundation located [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16?a=0xe596470d291cb2d32ec111afc314b07006690c72) will of course be excluded from earning rewards. **Please note that merely providing liquidity will NOT earn you FNX rewards, you MUST complete the next step.**

1. Visit the mining UI (which will be on [liquidity.finnexus.io](https://liquidity.finnexus.io)). With the UNI-V2 tokens from the previous step in your address, enter the amount of FNX/ETH UNI-V2 tokens you want to stake from your wallet. Once you have completed this step, you will begin to accrue FNX rewards.

## Distribution of FNX

The specific distribution rules will be as follows:

1. The total reward is fixed at 5000 FNX per day; (It was adjusted to 1000FNX since 30th Oct 2020)

1. FNX will be distributed pro-rata (proportionally) to those who contribute UNI-V2 tokens to the mining contract. Earlier stakers and stakers with higher value of stake will earn more FNX during this incentive program.

1. FNX rewards accrue in real-time. Token holders who have staked their FNX/ETH UNI-V2 tokens will need to “claim” their FNX token rewards on-chain. These rewards will not be automatically distributed. Please be aware of the ETH gas fees required to claim your FNX rewards. Your claimable rewards do not expire like they do in some DeFi protocols. They will be there for you whenever you get the chance to claim them. No need to worry about high gas fees or getting busy during the week.

1. Liquidity providers also earn a portion of the trading fees that accrue to the pool. With each transaction, the Uniswap Protocol assesses a 0.3% fee that accrues to the pool itself. When liquidity providers withdraw their UNI-V2 tokens from the mining UI on liquidity.finnexus.io, they will also be able to access their portion of accumulated transaction fees in the FNX/ETH liquidity pool.
