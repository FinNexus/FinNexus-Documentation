# Liquidity Mining

FinNexus is starting a liquidity mining program on Sushiswap since Feb 2021, where participants will be able to farm Sushi and FNX tokens together by providing FNX/ETH liquidity.

## Background

FNX/ETH was one of the assets included in the Sushiswap Onsen rewards system that went live in December 2020. Currently, the Sushi reward APY is over 100%.

## Implementation details

Following a favorable community vote, FinNexus is starting a new liquidity mining program on Sushiswap on February 10, 2021, with 3000 CFNX as daily mining rewards.

Incentives will be paid in convertible FNX (CFNX), which can be exchanged 1:1 to FNX.

Liquidity mining on Uniswap will end at the same time.

Please be aware that in order to convert, users must send the cFNX to the conversion contact. Afterward, 1/6th of the total cFNX burnt will be added to the user's redeemable FNX once a month over the following 6 months. The user may choose to redeem their FNX either once every month, or may choose to wait until they have accumulated enough and redeem it all together.

## How to mine Sushi and FNX together?

A notice will pop up once you open the [FinNexus Options UI](options.finnexus.io). This will take you to the [Sushi Onsen Program](https://www.sushiswap.fi/pair/0xaa500101c73065f755ba9b902d643705ef2523e3).

By contributing liquidity to the FNX/ETH pair and staking in the Onsen Farming Program, you will be automatically eligible for both Sushi and FNX rewards.

Sushi rewards can be claimed on the [Sushi Onsen page](https://www.sushiswap.fi/farms/special) by navigating to the FNX/ETH pair. Please note that the Sushi rewards will be vested according to [the Sushi farming rules](https://docs.sushiswap.fi/products/yield-farming/the-sushi-menu).

FNX rewards can be claimed on the 1st day of every month from our UI pop-ups.

The FinNexus team reserves the right to adjust the FNX mining rewards monthly according to the liquidity in the Sushiswap liquidity pool.
