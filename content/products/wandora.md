Wandora Box is a fun, fair, and simple game where users can win prizes by correctly predicting the price trend of WAN/BTC & other cryptos over a period of time. Any user who makes a correct prediction will win a prize. As a fun additional twist, all users who make a prediction will be enrolled in a lottery where they have a chance to win another prize, regardless of whether or not their prediction is correct.

Wandora Box can be accessed either through the [web version](https://wandora.finnexus.app/) or through the DApp Store in the official [Wanchain Wallet](https://www.wanchain.org/getstarted/).

## Development History

Wandora Box was the first DApp game on the Wanchain mainnet and the first to be included in the Wanchain DApp store.

[Wandora Box](https://wandora.finnexus.app/) hit the Wanchain mainnet on March 30th, 2020, as the first ever decentralized prediction game to launch on Wanchain. 

## How to Access Wandora Box

You can play the DApp now through either the DApp store in the [Wanchain Wallet](https://www.wanchain.org/getstarted/) or the web version [here](https://wandora.finnexus.app/) (Compatible with the [WanMask Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wanmask/omnkcjdohbnjfjmlaiboojplahajnenj?hl=en)).  
can know more updates.

## Game Rules
The game varies slightly according to the asset being predicted, but they all follow the same game cycle outlined below:

### WAN/BTC

1. Users predict whether the price of WAN/BTC will rise or fall within a time period (8 hours).

7. The remaining 99% shall be divided amongst the winners in each period. Losers will receive nothing and winners will receive an amount equal to the proportion of their bet vs the total amount of all winning bets. 

8. Regardless of winning or losing the Up/Down bet, all players have a chance of winning the prize pot.

## Step by Step Guide

You can select your wallet at the [Wandora Box app main page](https://wandora.finnexus.app/):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5072/1*mqCNqsjFyIuvRWVOOSsf4g.png)

To play, you choose an amount of WAN to place on your prediction, and your prediction of the price movement of the WAN / BTC trading pair (either UP or DOWN).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*NOY3MR4u63rxUZj1)

Wandora Box issues prizes every 8 hours, at 4 am, 12 noon and 8 pm (Beijing time — UTC+8).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2160/0*uaXkMc6zXACcYC6J)

At the end of each round, the prize pot will be divided amongst those who made correct predictions according to the the ratio of the amount each user placed on their prediction vs the total amount placed by all other users who made a correct prediction. (ie, if you placed 2 WAN and made a correct prediction, and the total amount placed on correct predictions including your 2 WAN is 20 WAN, then you will get 10% of the prize pot). The WAN will be automatically transferred to the player’s wallet address.

## Extra Lottery Game

In addition to allowing players to participate in predicting price changes to win rewards, Wandora Box also allows players to play another game simultaneously, a prize lottery. Players will automatically be entered in the lottery regardless of whether they guessed the WAN price UP or DOWN. The winners will be awarded the WAN in the lottery pool.

**Note:** Each time a player makes a prediction of UP or DOWN, 90% of the bet amount will go to prediction prize pool, and 10% will go to the lottery prize pool.

## Fair and verifiable random number generation algorithm

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2108/1*Kt9O2r3fCZ0XojJUX3rFlw.png)

Wandora Box uses the random number generation from Wanchain's PoS Galaxy Consensus mechanism. The Wandora Box game uses the random numbers generated as part of Galaxy Consensus to determine the results of the lottery.

The random number generation algorithm used in Galaxy Consensus complies with the 6 key elements of true random number generation:

**1. Decentralized**: If the random number generation process is decentralized, you do not need to rely on a trusted third party.

**2. Unpredictable:** It is impossible to predict future random numbers based on historically generated random numbers or other information. This is the basic requirement of “randomness”.

**3. Unbiased:** No one can use the computing power or latecomer advantage to target the random number generation result.

**4. Uniformity:** The output random number is uniformly distributed in its range.

**5. Guaranteed Output Delivery:** Participants in the random number generation algorithm cannot make it impossible to output random numbers by violating the algorithm, that is, random number output is bound to occur.

**6. Publicly Verifiable:** Nodes that are not involved in random number generation can monitor the implementation of the protocol in a posteriori manner to verify that the random number is credible and unbiased.

Therefore, the random number generation used to determine the winners in Wandora Box is safe, fair and publicly verifiable.
