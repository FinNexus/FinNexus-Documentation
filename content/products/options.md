# FinNexus Protocol for Options

The FinNexus Protocol for Options (FPO) is the cross-chain, permissionless protocol for options built by FinNexus. FPO launched on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Wanchain, with future plans to expand across a variety of different blockchains.

FPO v1.0 is a universal options protocol that enables the on-chain creation and trading of options or other derivatives on any type of underlying asset, powered by the collateral held in liquidity pools.

The model is flexible to create decentralized options on cryptoassets as well as real world assets.

The first experimental version of FPO v0.1 went live mid-year 2020 on Wanchain and was currently terminated for future upgrades. The official release of FPO v1.0 went live in Nov 2020 on Ethereum and Wanchain. The BSC version went live in April 2021.
