# FNX mining

Currently there are two ways of participating in the FNX ecosystem and gaining FNX mining rewards.

## FPO liquidity mining on Ethereum and Wanchain

The official version of the FinNexus Protocol for Options (FPO) v1.0 is online on the Ethereum and the Wanchain mainnet. Both versions will be accessible from [a joint UI](https://options.finnexus.io/#/).

A new mining program was online on 2021-01-25. Simply by depositing equivalent collateral assets in the collateral pool from the UI, and staking in the mining contracts, users will be eligible for mining rewards.

## [Uniswap liquidity mining](https://www.docs.finnexus.io/products/liquidity/)

The FinNexus Options Liquidity Mining DApp rewards participants with extra FNX for providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16).

Visit the [mining UI](https://liquidity.finnexus.io). With the UNI-V2 tokens you get from providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16), enter the amount of FNX/ETH UNI-V2 tokens you want to stake from your wallet. Once you have completed this step, you will begin to accrue FNX rewards.
