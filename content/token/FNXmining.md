# FNX mining

Currently there are two ways of participating in the FNX ecosystem and gaining FNX mining rewards.

## [Uniswap liquidity mining](https://www.docs.finnexus.io/products/liquidity/)

The FinNexus Options Liquidity Mining DApp rewards participants with extra FNX for providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16).

Visit the [mining UI](https://liquidity.finnexus.io). With the UNI-V2 tokens you get from providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16), enter the amount of FNX/ETH UNI-V2 tokens you want to stake from your wallet. Once you have completed this step, you will begin to accrue FNX rewards.
