# FNX mining

Currently there are two ways of participating in the FNX ecosystem and gaining FNX mining rewards.

## [Uniswap liquidity mining](https://www.docs.finnexus.io/products/liquidity/)

The FinNexus Options Liquidity Mining DApp rewards participants with extra FNX for providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16).

Visit the [mining UI](https://liquidity.finnexus.io). With the UNI-V2 tokens you get from providing liquidity to the [FNX/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x722885cab8be10b27f359fcb225808fe2af07b16), enter the amount of FNX/ETH UNI-V2 tokens you want to stake from your wallet. Once you have completed this step, you will begin to accrue FNX rewards.

## FPO collateal pool mining on [Ethereum](https://medium.com/finnexus/finnexus-defi-options-mainnet-goes-live-november-4th-on-ethereum-mark-the-date-46e49fe62ca4) and [Wanchain](https://medium.com/finnexus/finnexus-options-comes-to-wanchain-7528052faa8d)

The official version of the FinNexus Protocol for Options (FPO) v1.0 is online on the Ethereum and the Wanchain mainnet. Both versions will be accessible from [a joint UI](https://options.finnexus.io/#/).

Simply by depositing in the collateral pool from the UI, users will be eligible for the FNX mining rewards.
