# FinNexus Protocol for Options
The FinNexus Protocol for Options (FPO) is the cross-chain, permissionless protocol for options built by FinNexus. FPO launched first on Wanchanin, followed by Ethereum, and with future plans to expand across a variety of different blockchains.

The first experimental version of FPO v0.1 went live mid-year 2020, and the first whole number release v1.0 is scheduled to go live 3rd or 4th quarter 2020.

## Comparing v0.1 and v1.0

While the two versions may seem somewhat similar at first glance, there are significant differences. The primary difference between the two versions is their different approaches to generating options.

## v0.1 Individual Option Issuance

With the v0.1 model, options writers issue each option individually, and make profits or losses according to the market performance of each option they issue. While it is a reliable model, it has several downsides which we hope to address with v1.0.

## v1.0 Multi-Asset Single Pool (MASP)

v1.0 introduces the innovative Multi-Asset Single Pool (MASP) model for decentralized options. Under this model, a single monolithic pool of assets is used for the creation of ALL options. It allows for a decrease in risk for options writers and an increase in the variety of options available to options buyers

## Differences From Perspective of Users

From the options buyer's perspective, both protocols are broadly similar. Both allow for the buying, selling, and exercising of a variety of decentralized options.

The most significant difference between the two versions is on the option writer's side. With the v1.0 model, options writers my specify exactly the individual options they wish to issue. While this does give writers greater control, it also puts them at greater risk. When using the v1.0 model, the options writers simply contribute liquidity to a single monolithic pool, and all options are generated from that single pool. The rewards and risks are share proportionally amongst all liquidity providers. This gives liquidity providers the opportunity to make a relatively high and stable reward with relatively low risk.
