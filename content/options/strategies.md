## Protective Puts: A Hedging Strategy


A **protective put** position is created by buying (or owning) an asset and buying **put** options with a [strike price](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/strike-price/) equal or close to the current price of the asset. 

A protective put strategy is analogous to the nature of insurance. The main goal of a protective put is to limit potential losses that may result from an unexpected price drop of the underlying asset.

Adopting such a strategy does not put an absolute limit on the potential profits of the investor. Profits from the strategy are determined by the growth potential of the underlying asset. However, a portion of the profits is reduced by the premium paid for the put.

### Example of Protective Put

You own 100 ETH, with each ETH valued at $500. You believe that the price of ETH will increase in the future. However, you want to hedge against the risk of an unexpected price decline. Therefore, you decide to purchase 100 protective put contracts with a strike price of $500. The premium of one protective put is $10.

## Straddle Strategy

A straddle is a strategy accomplished by holding an equal number of puts and calls with the same strike price and expiration dates.

A straddle is meant to take advantage of the market price change by exploiting increased volatility, regardless of which direction the marketâ€™s price moves.
For example, I am not sure BTC is going to go upwards or downwards in the coming days. But I expect the movement will be big. I can buy a straddle from FinNexus options platform.

Suppose I buy a call and a put together with the strike price $19000. If the market moves up, the call is there; if the market moves down, the put is there. It may cost me like 500 USD in total. If the BTC rises above 19500, or fall below 18500, I will end up in profit.
What is more beneficial is that I can exercise the options and collect the profit anytime before they go expired.

This is a typical straddle strategy.

## Strangle Strategy


The **long strangle** involves going long (buying) both a [call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option) and a [put option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option) of the same underlying security. Like a [straddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddle), the options expire at the same time, but unlike a straddle, the options have different [strike prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_price).

A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.

The cost of a strangle can be lower than a straddle, as the options are [OTM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp).
The example is just like the one in the straddle strategy, well with different strike prices.
